# Vulnerability Report - example.com (Sample)

- Date: 2025-12-18
- Target: example.com
- Scope: Web + common internet-facing services
- Mode: PoC-only, timeouts tuned for speed

## Executive Summary
- Risk posture: Moderate. WAF present, core HTTPS is solid, but several hardening gaps remain.
- Key findings: Missing security headers, outdated HTTP server banner, directory exposure with potential admin panel, parameter fuzzing indicates injectable entry points (needs validation).
- Recommendations: Enable HSTS + CSP, tighten WAF rules on parameterized endpoints, remove unauthenticated admin panels or protect with SSO, patch server to latest LTS.

## Findings
1) **Security headers weak** (High)
- Evidence: Missing `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Frame-Options` on https://example.com/
- Impact: Increases exposure to clickjacking and content injection.
- Recommendation: Add HSTS (min 1 year), CSP default-deny with explicit allowlists, XFO=SAMEORIGIN.

2) **Outdated HTTP server banner** (Medium)
- Evidence: Server header reports "Apache/2.4.x" (enumerated via web fingerprinting and nmap scriptless scan)
- Impact: Potential known CVEs if version is unpatched.
- Recommendation: Patch to latest 2.4 LTS and suppress detailed banners.

3) **Directory exposure /admin** (Medium)
- Evidence: Directory fuzzing returned 200/302 on `/admin` and `/login` with form present.
- Impact: Expands attack surface for brute force and web vulns.
- Recommendation: Restrict by IP/VPN, add MFA/SSO, enforce rate limiting.

4) **Parameterized endpoint behavior suggests injection surface** (Medium)
- Evidence: Parameter fuzzing on `?q=` returned variant responses and 500 errors on certain payloads.
- Impact: Possible SQLi/command injection if back-end input validation is weak.
- Recommendation: Add server-side validation, parameterized queries, and tighten WAF rules; retest with authenticated context.

## Tooling Trace (sample)
- waf_detection: Detected Cloudflare; no blocking at low volume.
- web_fingerprint: Apache/2.4, OpenSSL TLS1.2/1.3, PHP detected.
- nmap (common ports): 80, 443 open; no SSH/DB ports exposed.
- nuclei (fallback): Flagged missing security headers.
- directory_fuzz (fallback): `/admin`, `/login` responsive.
- parameter_fuzz (fallback): `?q=` showed variant responses.
- ssl_test (fallback): Cert valid, modern ciphers, HSTS missing.

## Compliance & Scope
- Run was PoC-only; no destructive actions; no data exfiltration performed.
- Intended for authorized testing only. Contact for full evaluation run and scoped authorization.
